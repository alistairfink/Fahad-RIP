# Fahad RIP
This is my first attempt at making a React Native app using Expo and Expo's libraries. The concept of this app was to make a "memorial" app of my friend as a joke. I mainly made this app to experiment with React Native and Expo and I thought that the concept was funny so I went with that so I could send it to my friend. 

## Background Information
This concept might seem weird so a little background information might be required to fully understand why I made this. In my 2A term at the University of Waterloo I used to make jokes to my friend about how our other friend, who failed in our 1B term (when you fail you go to the next year's class), was dead to us. (Not really this was just a joke). But then that same friend that I made the joke to failed our 2A term. So I made this app as a joke. 

## Changes From Original
 To protect my friend's privacy I changed his picture to what can be seen in the screenshot below or the APK in the release folder. I also changed the song that is played when opening the app to a royalty free song that can be found here: https://www.bensound.com. Originally the song was Wiz Khalifa's "See You Again" ft. Charlie Puth. This song was switched out so as to not distribute copyrighted content via my GitHub.
